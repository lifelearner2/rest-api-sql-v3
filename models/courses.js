//This file contains Sequellize models for the app
// The Course model should include the following attributes set to the correct data type:
// title (String)
// description (Text)
// estimatedTime (String)
// materialsNeeded (String)
// userId (created in the model associations with the foreignKey property, and equals the id from the Users table)
// Pro Tip: When defining models for an existing database the model names and attributes need to match the tables in the database exactly otherwise Sequelize will throw an error.
