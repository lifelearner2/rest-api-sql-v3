//This file contains Sequellize models for the app

// The User model should include the following attributes set to the correct data type:
// firstName (String)
// lastName (String)
// emailAddress (String)
// password (String)
// Pro Tip: When defining models for an existing database the model names and attributes need to match the tables in the database exactly otherwise Sequelize will throw an error.
